- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" to describe a software problem originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. She famously taped the moth in her logbook with the annotation "First actual case of bug being found." Since then, the term "bug" has been widely used in the computer science community to refer to any glitch or error in a program.
